=== Races, Classes and Personalities ===

This file describes about the races, classes and personalities
available in Hengband; racial, class, personality tables are provided
at the bottom.


***** <TheRaces>
=== The Races ===

There are thirty seven different races that you can choose from in
Hengband.  Each race has various strengths and weaknesses and its own
adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.  Many races also
have intrinsic abilities and powers.  Their racial powers can be used
by the racial/class power command ("U"/"O").


***** <Human>
--- Human ---

    The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to
    them.  Humans can choose any class and are average at
    everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than most other
    races because of their shorter life spans.  No racial adjustments
    or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.


***** <Half-Elf>
--- Half-Elf ---

    Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as
    strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming,
    saving throws, stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good
    at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any class and do not
    receive any intrinsic abilities.


***** <Elf>
--- Elf ---

    Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
    fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans
    or half-elves and also have better wisdom.  Elves are better at
    searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and magic, but
    they are not as good at hand weapons.  They resist light effects
    intrinsically.


***** <Hobbit>
--- Hobbits ---

    Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have
    good saving throws.  They also are very good at searching,
    disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues,
    but prefer to be called burglars.  They are much weaker than
    humans, and no good at melee fighting.  Halflings have fair
    infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance.
    They have a strong hold on their life force, and are thus
    intrinsically resistant to life draining.


***** <Gnome>
--- Gnome ---

    Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings.  They,
    like the hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.  Gnomes
    make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws.  They are
    good at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They have
    lower strength than humans so they are not very good at fighting
    with hand weapons.  Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can
    detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance.  Gnomes are
    intrinsically protected against paralysis.


***** <Dwarf>
--- Dwarf ---

    Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  Dwarves
    tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent
    than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat
    wise, they resist spells which are cast on them.  They are very
    good at searching, perception, fighting, and bows.  Dwarves have a
    miserable stealth.  They can never be blinded.


***** <Half-Orc>
--- Half-Orc ---

    Half-orcs make excellent warriors, but are terrible at magic.
    They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching,
    disarming, and perception.  Half-orcs are quite ugly, and tend to
    pay more for goods in town.  Because of their preference to living
    underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist darkness attacks.


***** <Half-Troll>
--- Half-Troll ---

    Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than
    most other races.  They are also very stupid and slow.  They are
    bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They are so
    ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.  They also happen
    to be fun to run...  Half-trolls always have their strength
    sustained.  At higher levels, Half-Trolls regenerate wounds
    automatically, and if he or her is warrior slowly.


***** <Amberite>
--- Amberites ---

    The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with
    numerous advantages in addition to their longevity.  They are very
    tough and their constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability
    to heal wounds far surpasses that of any other race.  Having seen
    virtually everything, very little is new to them, and they gain
    levels much slower than the other races.


***** <High-Elf>
--- High-Elf ---

    High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning
    of time.  They are masters of all skills, and are strong and
    intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes suspect.
    High-elves begin their lives able to see the unseen, and resist
    light effects just like regular elves.  However, there are few
    things that they have not seen already, and experience is very
    hard for them to gain.


***** <Barbarian>
--- Barbarian ---

    Barbarians are hardy men of the north.  They are fierce in combat,
    and their wrath is feared throughout the world.  Combat is their
    life: they feel no fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at
    will even sooner than half-trolls.  Barbarians are, however,
    suspicious of magic, which makes magic devices fairly hard for
    them to use.


***** <Half-Ogre>
--- Half-Ogre ---

    Half-Ogres are like Half-Orcs, only more so.  They are big, bad,
    and stupid.  For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes,
    and they can even become wizards: after all, they are related to
    Ogre Magi, from whom they have learned the skill of setting
    trapped runes once their level is high enough.  Like Half-Orcs,
    they resist darkness, and like Half-Trolls, they have their
    strength sustained.


***** <Half-Giant>
--- Half-Giant ---

    Half-Giants limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to
    become full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make
    excellent warriors.  Their thick skin makes them resistant to
    shards, and like Half-Ogres and Half-Trolls, they have their
    strength sustained.


***** <Half-Titan>
--- Half-Titan ---

    Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely
    powerful creatures put almost any other race to shame.  They may
    lack the fascinating special powers of certain other races, but
    their enhanced attributes more than make up for that.  They learn
    to estimate the strengths of their foes, and their love for law
    and order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.


***** <Cyclops>
--- Cyclops ---

    With but one eye, a Cyclops can see more than many with two eyes.
    They are headstrong, and loud noises bother them very little.
    They are not quite qualified for the magic using professions, but
    as a certain Mr.  Ulysses can testify, their accuracy with thrown
    rocks can be deadly...


***** <Yeek>
--- Yeek ---

    Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures.  Fortunately, their
    horrible screams can scare away less confident foes, and their
    skin becomes more and more resistant to acid, as they gain
    experience.  But having said that, even a mediocre monster can
    wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.


***** <Klackon>
--- Klackon ---

    Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid
    creatures.  They make great fighters, but their mental abilities
    are severely limited.  Obedient and well-ordered, they can never
    be confused.  They are also very nimble, and become faster as they
    advance levels.  They are also very acidic, inherently resisting
    acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.


***** <Kobold>
--- Kobold ---

    Kobolds are a weak goblin race.  They love poisoned weapons, and
    can learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an
    unlimited supply).  They are also inherently resistant to poison,
    although they are not one of the more powerful races.


***** <Nibelung>
--- Nibelung ---

    The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these
    cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness.  Their natural
    inclination to magical items has made them immune to effects which
    could drain away magical energy.


***** <Dark-Elf>
--- Dark Elf ---

    Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness
    attacks, the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of
    magic.  They have an inherent magic missile attack available to
    them at a low level.  With their keen sight, they also learn to
    see invisible things as their relatives High-Elves do, but at a
    higher level.


***** <Draconian>
--- Draconian ---

    A humanoid race with dragon-like attributes.  As they advance
    levels, they gain new elemental resistances (up to Poison
    Resistance), and they also have a breath weapon, which becomes
    more powerful with experience.  The exact type of the breath
    weapon depends on the Draconian's class and level.  With their
    wings, they can easily escape any pit trap unharmed.


***** <Mindflayer>
--- Mind Flayer ---

    A secretive and mysterious ancient race.  Their civilization may
    well be older than any other on our planet, and their intelligence
    and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so great that they
    enable Mind Flayers to become more powerful spellcasters than any
    other race, even if their physical attributes are a good deal less
    admirable.  As they advance levels, they gain the powers of See
    Invisible and Telepathy.


***** <Imp>
--- Imp ---

    A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant to
    fire attacks, and capable of learning fire bolt and fire ball
    attacks.  They are little loved by other races, but can perform
    fairly well in most professions.  As they advance levels, they
    gain the powers of See Invisible.


***** <Golem>
--- Golem ---

    A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw
    material like clay, and awakened to life.  They are nearly
    mindless, making them useless for professions which rely on magic,
    but as warriors they are very tough.  They are resistant to
    poison, they can see invisible things, and move freely.  At higher
    levels, they also become resistant to attacks which threaten to
    drain away their life force.  Golems gain very little nutrition
    from ordinary food, but can absorb mana from staves and wands as
    their power source.  Golems also gain a natural armor class bonus
    from their tough body.


***** <Skeleton>
--- Skeleton ---

    There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-like
    skeletons, and the spell-using skeletons, which are also called
    liches.  As undead beings, skeletons need to worry very little
    about poison or attacks that can drain life.  They do not really
    use eyes for perceiving things, and are thus not fooled by
    invisibility.  Their bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and
    they will quickly become resistant to cold.  Although the magical
    effects of these will affect the skeleton even without entering
    the skeleton's (non-existent) belly, the potion or food itself
    will fall through the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional
    benefit.  They can absorb mana from staves and wands as their
    energy source.


***** <Zombie>
--- Zombie ---

    Much like Skeletons, Zombies too are undead horrors: they are
    resistant to life-draining attacks, and can learn to restore their
    life-force.  Like skeletons, they become resistant to cold-based
    attacks (actually earlier than skeletons), resist poison and can
    see invisible.  While still vulnerable to cuts (unlike skeletons),
    Zombies are resistant to Nether.  Like Golems, they gain very
    little nutrition from the food of mortals, but can absorb mana
    from staves and wands as their energy source.


***** <Vampire>
--- Vampire ---

    One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an
    awe-inspiring sight.  Yet this dread creature has a serious
    weakness: the bright rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to
    flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until the sun
    finally sets.  Darkness, on the other hand, only makes the Vampire
    stronger.  As undead, the Vampire has a firm hold on its life
    force, and resists nether attacks.  The Vampire also resists cold
    and poison based attacks.  It is, however, susceptible to its
    perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by
    sucking the blood from a nearby monster.


***** <Spectre>
--- Spectre ---

    Another powerful undead creature: the Spectre is a ghastly
    apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow.  They exist
    only partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can
    pass through walls, although the density of the wall will hurt
    them in the process of doing this.  As undead, they have a firm
    hold on their life force, see invisible, and resist poison and
    cold.  They also resist nether.  At higher levels they develop
    telepathic abilities.  Spectres make superb spellcasters, but
    their physical form is very weak.  They gain very little nutrition
    from the food of mortals, but can absorb mana from staves and
    wands as their energy source.


***** <Sprite>
--- Sprite ---

    One of the several fairy races, Sprites are very small.  They have
    tiny wings and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them.
    They enjoy sunlight intensely, and need worry little about light
    based attacks.  Although physically among the weakest races,
    Sprites are very talented in magic, and can become highly skilled
    wizards.  Sprites have the special power of spraying Sleeping
    Dust, and at higher levels they learn to fly faster.


***** <Beastman>
--- Beastman ---

    "This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos.  It is
    not an independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often
    a human, twisted by the Chaos, or a nightmarish crossbreed of a
    human and a beast.  All Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much
    that they are untroubled by confusion and sound, although raw
    logrus can still have effects on them.  Beastmen revel in chaos,
    as it twists them more and more.  Beastmen are subject to
    mutations: when they have been created, they receive a random
    mutation.  After that, every time they advance a level they have a
    small chance of gaining yet another mutation.


***** <Ent>
--- Ent ---

    The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the
    world, oldest of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda.  Spirits
    of the land, they were summoned to guard the forests of
    Middle-earth.  Being much like trees they are very clumsy but
    strong, and very susceptible to fire.  They gain very little
    nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can absorb water from
    potions as their nutrition.


***** <Archon>
--- Archon ---

    Archons are a higher class of angels.  They are good at all
    skills, and are strong, wise, and are a favorite with any people.
    They are able to see the unseen, and their wings allow them to
    safely fly over traps and other dangerous places.  However,
    belonging to a higher plane as they do, the experiences of this
    world do not leave a strong impression on them and they gain
    levels slowly.


***** <Balrog>
--- Balrog ---

    Balrogs are a higher class of demons.  They are strong,
    intelligent and tough.  They do not believe in gods, and are not
    suitable for priest at all.  Balrog are resistant to fire and
    nether, and have a firm hold on their life force.  They also
    eventually learn to see invisible things.  They are good at almost
    all skills except stealth.  They gain very little nutrition from
    the food of mortals, and need human corpses as sacrifices to
    regain their vitality.


***** <Dunadan>
--- Dunadan ---

    Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race
    surpasses human abilities in every field, especially constitution.
    However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and
    levels are very hard for them to gain.  Their constitution cannot
    be reduced.


***** <Shadow-Fairy>
--- Shadow Fairy ---

    Shadow Fairies are one of the several fairy races.  They have
    wings, and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them.
    Shadow Fairies must beware of sunlight, as they are vulnerable to
    bright light.  They are physically weak, but have advantages in
    using magic and are amazingly stealthy.  Shadow Fairies have a
    wonderful advantage in that they never aggravate monsters (If
    their equipment normally aggravates monsters, they only suffer a
    penalty to stealth, but if they aggravate by their personality
    itself, the advantage will be lost).


***** <Kutar>
--- Kutar ---

    A Kutar is an expressionless animal-like living creature.  The
    word 'kuta' means 'absentmindedly' or 'vacantly'.  Their
    absentmindedness hurts their searching and perception skills, but
    renders them incapable of being confused.  Their unearthly
    calmness and serenity make them among the most stealthy of any
    race.  Kutars, although expressionless, are beautiful and so have
    a high charisma.  Members of this race can learn to expand their
    body horizontally.  This increases armour class, but renders them
    vulnerable to magical attacks.


***** <Android>
--- Android ---

    An android is a artificial creation with a body of machinery.
    They are poor at spell casting, but they make excellent warriors.
    They don't acquire experience like other races, but rather gain in
    power as they attach new equipment to their frame.  Rings,
    amulets, and lights do not influence growth.  Androids are
    resistant to poison, can move freely, and are immune to
    life-draining attacks.  Moreover, because of their hard metallic
    bodies, they get a bonus to AC.  Androids have electronic circuits
    throughout their body and must beware of electric shocks.  They
    gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can
    use flasks of oil as their energy source.


***** <TheClasses>
=== The Classes ===
 
There are twenty seven different classes that you can choose from in
Hengband.  Each class has various strengths and weaknesses and its own
adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.  Many classes also
have intrinsic abilities and powers.  These are often linked to the
character's experience level and only become available later in the
game.  Their class powers can be used by the racial/class power
command("U"/"O").


***** <Warrior>
--- Warrior ---

    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his
    problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall
    back on the help of a magical device.  Unfortunately, many
    high-level devices may be forever beyond their use.

    Warriors cast no spells.  They hate magic.  In fact, they even
    gain experience for destroying high level spellbooks.  They have a
    class power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a
    melee attack in six random directions.


***** <Mage>
--- Mage ---

    A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot
    hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior.
    In addition to his spellbooks, a Mage should carry a range of
    magical devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master
    far more easily than anyone else.  A Mage's prime statistic is
    Intelligence as this determines his spell casting ability.

    Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells.
    They can freely choose any two realms when a character is created.
    Their natural inclination makes Life magic fairly hard to learn.
    Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and cast all the spells in his or
    her realms better than any other character.  The ability to choose
    second realm of magic has a special meaning in Hengband; only
    second realm can be changed in the middle of the game.  You can
    change second realm by studying ("G") from a spellbook of new
    realm.  They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana
    from wands, staves or rods.


***** <Priest>
--- Priest ---

    A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power.  They
    explore the dungeon in the service of their God.  Since Priests
    receive new prayers as gifts from their patron deity, they cannot
    choose which ones they will learn.  Priests are familiar with
    magical devices which they believe act as foci for divine
    intervention in the natural order of things.  A priest wielding an
    edged weapon will be so uncomfortable with it that his fighting
    ability.  A Priest's primary stat is Wisdom since this determine
    his success at praying to his deity.

    Priest can select from Life, Death, Daemon, or Crusade as a first
    realm, and choose second realm almost freely.  But pairs of a good
    magic and an evil magic from these four realms are not allowed.
    Priests can learn all spells in the selected realms, even if not
    as efficiently as mages.  However, when learning spells, priests
    cannot voluntarily decide which spells to study: they are rewarded
    with new prayers by their patron deities, with no money-back
    satisfaction guarantee.  Priests which select Life realm or
    Crusade realm have a class power - 'Bless Weapon' - which blesses
    any edged weapon to be suitable for priests to wield.  Every
    priest which select Death realm or Daemon realm have a class power
    - 'Evocation' - which damages, scares and banish all monsters in
    sight.


***** <Rogue>
--- Rogue ---

    A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is
    capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  Rogues are good
    at locating hidden traps and doors and are the masters of
    disarming traps and picking locks.  A rogue has a high stealth
    allowing him to sneak around many creatures without having to
    fight, or to get in a telling first blow.  A rogue may also
    backstab a fleeing monster.  Intelligence determines a Rogue's
    spell casting ability.

    Rogues can select one realm from Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, or
    Craft.  All Rogues have certain limitations on which spells they
    can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly.  They
    have a class power - 'Hit and Away' - which allows them to attack
    in melee and teleport away from there at once.


***** <Ranger>
--- Ranger ---

    A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has
    developed a special affinity for the natural world around him.  He
    is a good fighter and also good about a missile weapon such as a
    bow.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
    searching, a good saving throw and is good with magical devices.
    Intelligence determines a Ranger's spell casting ability.

    All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all Nature spells are
    available to them.  They even learn these spells almost as fast as
    mages.  They can also select a secondary realm (from Sorcery,
    Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon), but they are slow
    learners here, and may find themselves unable to learn some of the
    highest level spells.  They have a class power - 'Probe Monster' -
    which allows them to know a monster's HP, speed, and experience
    required to evolve.


***** <Paladin>
--- Paladin ---

    A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest.  Paladins
    are very good fighters, but not very good at missile weapons.  A
    paladin lacks much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at
    stealth, perception, searching, and magical devices but has a
    decent saving throw due to his divine alliance.  Wisdom determines
    a Paladin's success at praying to his deity.

    Paladins can select a realm from Crusade and Death.  Like priests,
    they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with
    new prayers by their deities.  They can learn all spells, but not
    as fast as priests.  They detest paganism so strongly that they
    will even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan spell-
    books: 'pagan' means Life or Crusade spellbooks for a Death
    Paladin and all spellbooks other than Life and Crusade for a
    Crusade Paladin.  Depending on their realm, they have a class
    power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.


***** <Warrior-Mage>
--- Warrior-Mage ---

    A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross
    between the warrior and mage classes.  While their brothers, the
    rangers, specialize in Nature magic and survival skills, true
    Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the best of both worlds.  As
    warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage class.
    Intelligence determines a Warrior-Mage's spell casting ability.

    Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can
    freely select another realm of magic.  Although they do not gain
    new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn
    every spell in both realms, thus making them a very competitive
    choice for players who appreciate Arcane magic.  They have two
    class powers - 'Convert HP to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP' - which
    allow them to heal HP using mana or gain mana using HP.


***** <Chaos-Warrior>
--- Chaos-Warrior ---

    Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords
    of Chaos.  Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and, when
    gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron.  He might
    be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or he
    might be rewarded with an awesome weapon.  On the other hand, the
    Patrons might surround him with monsters, drain his stats or wreck
    his equipment or they might simply ignore him.  The Demon Lords of
    Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed.  The exact type of
    reward depends on both the Patron Demon (different Demons give
    different rewards) and chance.

    Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon.  They are
    not interested in any other form of magic.  They can learn every
    spell.  They have a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which stuns,
    confuses, and scares all monsters in sight.


***** <Monk>
--- Monk ---

    The Monk character class is very different from all other classes.
    Their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with
    no armor or weapons.  To gain the resistances necessary for
    survival a monk may need to wear some kind of armor, but if the
    armor he wears is too heavy, it will severely disturb his martial
    arts maneuvers.  As the monk advances levels, new, powerful forms
    of attack become available.  Their defensive capabilities increase
    likewise, but if armour is being worn, this effect decreases.
    Wisdom determines a Monk's spell casting ability.

    The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of
    magic.  They select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, and Death.
    They will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their
    choice.  They have two class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and
    'Double Attack'.  They can choose different forms of postures in
    different situations, and use powerful combinations of attacks for
    the finishing blow.


***** <Mindcrafter>
--- Mindcrafter ---

    The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind
    instead of magic.  These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and
    vary from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of
    others.  Since these powers are developed by the practice of
    certain disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use
    them.  The available powers are simply determined by the
    character's level.  Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's ability to
    use mind powers,

    Mindcrafters gain new mindcrafting powers and their existing ones
    become stronger as they gain levels.  They can use their power
    even when blinded.  They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which
    allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.


***** <High-Mage>
--- High-Mage ---

    High-mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of
    magic and learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage.
    A high mage's prime statistic is intelligence as this determines
    his spell casting ability.

    For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, High-mages
    gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, minimum levels, and
    failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm.  They have
    a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands,
    staves, or rods.

    And then, only High-Mages are able to cast Hex spells.


***** <Tourist>
--- Tourist ---

    Tourists have visited this world for the purpose of sightseeing.
    Their fighting skills is bad, and they cannot cast powerful
    spells.  They are the most difficult class to win the game with.
    Intelligence determines a tourist's spell casting ability.

    Tourists are always seeing more of the world to add to their stock
    of information; no other class can compete with their
    identification skills.  They have two class powers - 'Take a
    Photograph' and 'Identify True'.  Their magic is based on Arcane,
    and - aside from identify - is very weak indeed.


***** <Imitator>
--- Imitator ---

    Imitators have enough fighting skills to survive, but rely on
    their unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates monster
    spells/techniques include whose damage/duration value.  Dexterity
    determines general imitation ability, but a stat related to the
    specific action is often also taken into account.

    To use imitation, Imitators must see monster's spell at first.
    When monsters in view use spells, they are added to a temporary
    spell list which the imitator can choose among.  Spells should be
    imitated quickly, because timing and situation are everything.  An
    imitator can only repeat a spell once each time he observes it.
    They only have a small long-term memory for spells, which ranges
    from one to three, depending on their level.  When they memorize
    more spells than this, they will forget the oldest spell in the
    list.  They have a class power - 'Double Revenge' - which allows
    them to imitate spells at double damage or duration.


***** <BeastMaster>
--- BeastMaster ---

    Beastmasters are in tune with the minds of the creatures of the
    world of Hengband.  They are very good at riding, and have enough
    fighting ability.  They use monsters which summoned or dominated
    by him as his hands and feet.  Beastmasters can cast trump magic,
    and very good at summoning spell, but they can not summon
    non-living creatures.  Charisma determines a Beastmaster's spell
    casting ability.

    Beastmasters use Trump magic to make good use of their monster
    domination and riding abilities.  They are very good at summoning
    living creatures, and they learn summoning spells quicker than
    Mages.  However, they cannot summon non-living creatures.  They
    have two class powers - 'Dominate a Living Thing' and 'Dominate
    Living Things'.


***** <Sorcerer>
--- Sorcerer ---

    Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to cast
    any spell from most magic realms without having to learn it.  On
    the downside, they are the worst fighters in the dungeon, being
    unable to use any weapon but a Wizardstaff.

    Sorcerers can cast any spell from any spellbooks of all nine magic
    realms with 'Master' proficiency level without having to learn it.
    They have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from
    wands, staves or rods.


***** <Archer>
--- Archer ---

    Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee.  They are the best
    class around with any bow, crossbow, or sling.  They need a lot of
    ammunition, but will learn how to make it from junk found in the
    dungeon.  An archer is better than a warrior at stealth,
    perception, searching and magical devices.

    Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates stones
    or shots from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts from
    bones.


***** <Magic-Eater>
--- Magic-Eater ---

    Magic-Eaters can absorb magic devices, and use these magics as
    their spells.  They are middling-poor at fighting.  A
    Magic-Eater's prime statistic is intelligence.

    Magic-Eaters can absorb the energy of wands, staffs, and rods, and
    can then use these magics as if they were carrying all of these
    absorbed devices.  Mana and changes of absorbed devices are
    regenerated naturally by a Magic-Eater's power, and speed of
    regeneration is influenced by their intelligence.  They have a
    class power - 'Absorb Magic' - which is used to absorb magic
    devices.


***** <Bard>
--- Bard ---

    Bards are something like traditional musicians.  Their magical
    attacks are sound-based, and last as long as the Bard has mana.
    Although a bard cannot sing two or more songs at the same time, he
    or she does have the advantage that many songs affect all areas in
    sight.  A bard's prime statistic is charisma.

    The songs are found in four songbooks, of which two are sold in
    town.  There is a special feature of music; many songs continue to
    be sung until either the Bard chooses to stop, or he runs out of
    the energy required to sing that type of song.  Bards have a class
    power - 'Stop Singing'.


***** <Red-Mage>
--- Red-Mage ---

    Red Mages are similar to Warrior-Mage; they are decent fighters
    and spellcasters.  Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower
    rank spellbooks of all realms, but they cannot cast spells from
    higher rank spellbooks, and they are extremely slow learners in
    them.  They are not bad at using magical devices and magic
    resistance, but are bad at other skills.  A red-mage's prime
    statistic is intelligence.

    Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank spellbooks of
    all realms: first and second spellbooks of all realms and third
    and fourth Arcane spellbooks, without having to learn it, but they
    cannot cast spells from higher rank spellbooks; third and fourth
    spellbooks for all realms other than Arcane.  Since they use all
    realms at once, they have large penalties in the mana costs,
    minimum levels, and failure rates of spells.  They have a class
    power - 'Double Magic' - which allows them to cast two spells at
    once.


***** <Samurai>
--- Samurai ---

    Samurai, masters of the art of the blade, are the next strongest
    fighters after Warriors, and can use various special combat
    techniques.  Samurai are not good at most other skills, and many
    magical devices may be too difficult for them to use.  Wisdom
    determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat
    techniques available to him.

    Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei).  Books
    of Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to
    carry them around; the books are needed only when they study new
    combat techniques.  Samurai need a weapon wielded to use the
    techniques of Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful special
    properties to their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric,
    etc...  Their maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but
    solely on wisdom, and they can use the class power 'Concentration'
    to temporarily increase SP beyond its usual maximum value.  They
    have one more class power - 'Assume a Posture'.  They can choose
    different forms of posture in different situations.


***** <ForceTrainer>
--- ForceTrainer ---

    A ForceTrainer is a master of the spiritual Force.  They prefer
    fighting with neither weapon nor armor.  They are not as good
    fighters as are Monks, but they can use both magic and the
    spiritual Force.  Wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs
    use of the Force.  Wisdom is a ForceTrainer's primary stat.

    ForceTrainer use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual
    power called the Force.  They can select a realm from Life,
    Nature, Craft, Death, and Crusade.  To use The Force, you select
    it just as if it were spellbook 'w'; which means you need to press
    'm' and then 'w' to select the Force.  The most important spell of
    the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a ForceTrainer activates
    it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and their attack
    power in bare-handed melee fighting is increased temporarily.  The
    strengthened Force can be released at one stroke when a
    ForceTrainer activates some other Force spell, typically an attack
    spell.  They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them
    to rapidly regenerate their mana.


***** <Blue-Mage>
--- Blue-Mage ---

    A Blue-Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits, as he
    cannot hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a
    warrior.  A major difference between the Mage and the Blue-Mage is
    the method of learning spells: Blue-Mages may learn spells from
    monsters.  A Blue-Mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this
    determines his spell casting ability.

    A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster ranged attacks, spells, or
    summons as their own spells; this technique is called Blue magic.
    Unlike Imitators, Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently,
    but they must get hit by a monster's spell while their class power
    'Learning' is active to learn spells.  Because of this
    requirement, they do not learn spells, like healing, that affect
    the monster itself.


***** <Cavalry>
--- Cavalry ---

    Cavalry ride on horses into battle.  Although they cannot cast
    spells, they are proud of their overwhelming offensive strength on
    horseback.  They are good at shooting.  At high levels, they learn
    to forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters.  Since they take pride
    in the body and the soul, they don't use magical devices well.

    Like Warriors and Archers, the cavalry don't use magic.  Since
    they are very good at riding, they have a class power - 'Rodeo' -
    which allows them to forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters.


***** <Berserker>
--- Berserker ---

    A Berserker is a fearful fighter indeed, immune to fear and
    paralysis.  At high levels, Berserkers can reflect bolt spells
    with their tough flesh.  Furthermore, they can fight without
    weapons, can remove cursed equipment by force, and can even use
    their special combat techniques when surrounded by an anti-magic
    barrier.  Berserkers, however, cannot use any magical devices or
    read any scrolls, and are hopeless at all non-combat skills.
    Since Berserker Spectres are quite easy to *win* with, their 
    scores are lowered.

    Berserkers use a unique system of techniques called 'Rage'.  They
    gain more techniques as they gain levels.  They use no magic:
    indeed, they cannot use any magic devices or activate any
    artifacts, and cannot read scrolls.  To offset these great
    disadvantages, Berserkers are allowed to have an important class
    power - 'Recall'.


***** <Weaponsmith>
--- Weaponsmith ---

    A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors for him or herself.
    They are good at fighting, and they have potential ability to
    become even better than Warriors using improved equipments.  They
    cannot cast spells, and are poor at skills such as stealth or
    magic defense.

    A Weaponsmith extract the essences of special effects from weapons
    or armors which have various special abilities, and can add these
    essences to another weapon or armor.  Normally, each equipment can
    be improved only once, but they can remove a previously added
    essence from improved equipment to improve it with another
    essence.  To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can be improved freely
    up to a maximum value depending on level.  Weaponsmiths have a
    class power - 'Judgment' - which allows them to identify (later
    *identify*) weapons and armor.


***** <Mirror-Master>
--- Mirror-Master ---

    Mirror-Masters are spell casters; like other mages, they must live
    by their wits.  They can create magical mirrors, and employ them
    in the casting of Mirror-Magic spells.  Intelligence determines a
    Mirror-Master's spell casting ability.

    Mirror-Masters gain more spells and each spell becomes more
    powerful as they gain levels.  They can use their spells even when
    blinded.  For Mirror-Masters, the arrangement of mirrors is very
    important: Some attack spells reflect from mirrors, and some other
    spells are effective only against monsters standing on a mirror.
    A Mirror-Master standing on a mirror has greater ability and, for
    example, can perform quick teleports.  The maximum number of
    magical Mirrors which can be controlled simultaneously depends on
    the level, and breaking unnecessary mirrors is important work for
    them.  They have two class powers - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks
    all mirrors in current dungeon level and 'Mirror Concentration',
    which allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana on a mirror.


***** <Ninja>
--- Ninja ---

    A Ninja is a fearful assassin lurking in darkness.  He or she can
    navigate effectively with no light source, catch enemies unawares,
    and kill with a single blow.  Ninjas can use Ninjutsu, and are
    good at locating hidden traps and doors, disarming traps and
    picking locks.  Since heavy armors, heavy weapons, or shields will
    restrict their motion greatly, they prefer light clothes, and
    become faster and more stealthy as they gain levels.  A Ninja
    knows no fear and, at high level, becomes almost immune to poison
    and able to see invisible things.  Dexterity determines a Ninja's
    ability to use Ninjutsu.

    A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks.  They
    gain more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels.  They have a
    class power - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking speed
    extremely fast.


***** <Sniper>
--- Sniper ---
    Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who 
    fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession.  They don't just
    increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use
    fearsome archery techniques.  

    What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality 
    ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under 
    any situation.  

    Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows.
    They have no time for magic.

=== Ability Tables ===

Each of the races, classes, and personalities has certain
modifications to their starting abilities. Players may also receive an
additional level-based bonus to certain skills which is based on their
class. For example mages improve their magical device skill more
rapidly than warriors. As noted above, some skills will not improve
unless magically enhanced.

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the
base level of the ability, while the second figure is the bonus that
the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character's skills, add the "race" value
to the "class" value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels
that the character has.

the 50th level.
