Hengband can automatically pick up or destroy specified objects when
you write objects name in the file "pickpref.prf" or
"pickpref-<<playername>>.prf" in the user directory, this will be
~/.angband/Hengband/ for UNIX, or Hengband\lib\user\ for other
operating systems.

The game will read the file "pickpref-<<playername>>.prf" first and
then read the file "pickpref.prf".  The first-read file takes
priority.

You may use the '$' command within the game to reread auto-picker
files.

Notes:
Maximum number of active lines is 1009.
A line with a header '#' is a comment.

--- Editing the file ---

Command letter:

      Each line determines the actions taken when you step over a kind
  of object.  Starting a line with '!' indicates that you wish to
  destroy this kind of object.  Starting a line with '~' indicates
  that you wish to leave this kind of object on the floor.  Starting a
  line with ';' indicates that you wish to force the game to ask you
  if you want to pick the item up or not.  Otherwise, your character
  will automatically attempt to pick up the object.
       There is an additional command letter '('.  It indicates that
  you don't wish this item to be displayed in full map. see below.

  Notes:
  If you want to disable the effect of the '!' indicator temporally,
  use 'always_pickup' option.


Keywords:
       After the command letter may come one or more keywords.  They are:

  all               : All items match.
  collecting        : Matches if you already have that same item.
  unaware           : Items with unknown effects match.

  You may also use keywords which match specified kinds of equipment:
  weapons, armors, missiles, magical devices, lights, junks, spellbooks, 
  hafted weapons, shields, bows, rings, amulets, suits, cloaks, helms, 
  gloves, boots


Character strings:
       After the keywords, you may write a character string. Only items 
  whose name contains this character string as part of their name match. 
  Upper or lower case makes no difference.
       You must insert a ':' between your special keywords and character 
  string, if both exist in one line.

Force start-of-line matching:
  If the first character in a character string is '^', then the 
  character string must match the beginning of a line.

!Mace           // Destroy Maces and Lead-Filled Maces.
!^Mace          // Destroy only Maces.


Examples:

!worthless items
Meaning:  "destroy all items that are worthless"

unaware potion
Meaning:  "pick up all unaware potions"

~unidentified lites
Meaning:  "leave all unidentified light sources on the ground"

unidentified more than 25 dice weapons
Meaning:  "pick up all weapons with dice that total more than 25.  A 
     weapon that is 2d13 qualifies, a weapon that is 5d5 does not."

Acquirement
Meaning:  "pick up anything that includes in its name the word 
'Acquirement'"

potion of Experience
Meaning:  "pick up anything named 'potion of experience'"

Lights:stone
Meaning:  "Pick up light sources named stone"

gloves:slaying
Meaning:  "Pick up gauntlets of slaying. Not rings of slaying."


Special Notes:

  Lines will be evaluated in order, and first matched line will be 
  applied. So you can write names of specific excellent items to pick 
  up, followed by a general item name with '!' to destroy useless items.

  ! Tips
  !     In full map command ('M'), you can press M, N, K, or D to 
  ! display locations of items for auto-pickup, leaving, auto-destroy 
  ! or both auto-pickup and leaving.
  !     Additional command letter '(' prevents this display.
  !

  If you begin the last string in a line with '#', this string will
  be automatically inscribed on the item.


  Strict syntax of each line is below.
